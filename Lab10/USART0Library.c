 *	    File: USART0Library.c
 *  Lab Name: (Needed for Bluetooth-controlled ZUMO Bots final project, S2019)
 *    Author: Dr. Greg Nordstrom
 *   Created: 3/3/2019
 *  Modified: 
 * Processor: ATmega128A (on the ReadyAVR board)
 *
 * This is intended to be compiled as an AVR Library Project and
 * used by other programs. After compiling this code, copy the
 * libUSART0Library.a and USART0Library.h files to the project directory,
 * then add the library to the target project by R-clicking on the
 * project's Libraries directory and clicking Add Library. Also,
 * the USART0Library.h file must be #included in the project's .c file.
 *
 * NOTE: This library only works with the default USART0 port on the
 * ReadyAVR. However, USART1 is the default for uploading code and
 * debugging, and that requires JP2 to have jumpers on PD3 and PD2.
 * It's best to leave USART1 as the default for uploading and debugging,
 * and using USART0 as an extra, independent USART by connecting 
 * external RS232 signals DIRECTLY to pin PE0 (Rx) and PE1 (Tx). This
 * arrangement allows for development via Atmel Studio as well as for
 * controlling RS232 devices via USART0 (e.g. a Bluetooth HC-05 module).

// Use USART0_init to initialize the USART hardware in the AVR processor.
// The function takes the following arguments:
//    - desired baud rate (standard values from 2400 to 115200,
//    - number of databits (5-8),
//    - number of stop bits (1,2),
//    - parity (0=no parity, 1=odd parity, 2=even parity).
// No error checking is performed and the function does not return a value.
//
// For example,
//     usart0_init(9600,8,1,0);
// sets the baudrate to 9600, with 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and no parity
